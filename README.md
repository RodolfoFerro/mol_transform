# `mol_transform` üíª‚öóÔ∏è

Molecular transformations for graphic displaying using Cartesian coordinates.

## How to use it

#### Generalities:
The `-f` tag stands for `file` and will open the file named `input.xyz`, center the first position into the origin and translate the rest of positions to maintain the structure. The `-o` tag stands for `output`, meaning that you need to add the output path (in our example is `output.xyz`).
Both tags (`-f` and `-o`) are needed.


- ### Centering

Simply run:
```bash
python mol_transform.py -f input.xyz -o output.xyz
```
**PLEASE OBSERVE** that we won't need need any extra parameters for a molecule translation to the center of our Cartesian space.

- ### Translating

To translate a molecule using a specific vector `(a, b, c)`, we'll need to use the `-t` tag (that stands to `translate`) and run:
```bash
python mol_transform.py -f input.xyz -o output.xyz -t -a -b -c
```

For instance, we have the position `(0.47050, -0.66520, -1.79270)` in our file `C20.xyz` and if we want to translate it to the origin (and the rest of the positions to maintain the structure), we would have to run:
```bash
python mol_transform.py -f C20.xyz -o C20_translated.xyz -t -0.47050 0.66520 1.79270
```
**PLEASE OBSERVE** that we need the inverted signs of each value of the position, since we want a negative translation to that position. Also, in this example we will create the file `C20_translated.xyz` with the translated positions.


- ### Scaling

To scale the molecule along the 3-axis by a vector `(a, b, c)`, we'll need to use the `-s` tag (that stands to `scale`) and run:
```bash
python mol_transform.py -f input.xyz -o output.xyz -s a b c
```

For instance in our file `C20.xyz`, if we want to scale it to the double of size we would have to run:
```bash
python mol_transform.py -f C20.xyz -o scaled.xyz -s 2 2 2
```
